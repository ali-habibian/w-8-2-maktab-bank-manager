We would like you to write a simple financial application.
This application should provide an API to register a user, each user can have multiple
account connected to their user.

You should also provide another API to transfer money between accounts based on account numbers.

In addition, we want to keep track of every money transfers including withdraw account, deposit account,
transaction time, and the transferred amount.

The applicationâ€™s currency is IRR (Rial) and it does not need to support other currencies.
You should deliver an API for reporting transactions based on time and account number.
